        <p>It’s no secret that the Phones are Bad. We all know this. Some of us
            are able to bracket the deleterious psychologiacl effects of Phone and
            get on with our days. I applaud them, but I am not one of them. Some of
            us (me) are not so well-equipped. For some of us (me), Phone offers a
            bottomless abyss of distraction and temptation, a simulacrum of social
            participation and knowledge acquisition, all yoked to corporatocratic
            algorithms that yadda yadda yadda honestly I’m bored even typing it out,
            we all know the spiel, we have been trapped in this hell for fifteen
            years now with no sign of it abating but that doesn’t make it any more
            interesting. We know the story. Maybe Phone will destroy society as we
            know it. Maybe it already has!</p>
        <p>Still, I wanted to know whether or not there could be a world
            outside, after, or beyond Phone.</p>
        <p>So at the beginning of October I bought a flip phone, a TCL Flip 2.
            It was sixty dollars. It’s made by the same Chinese company that makes
            my TV. It makes calls. It sends texts. It doesn’t have Snake. I hooked
            it up to a cheap phone plan and waited for it to fix me.</p>
        <p>I will warn you now that there are no grand insights in this blog
            post. I wanted a post-Phone world, a world where phones were just phones
            and not Phones. I didn’t really get it. The flip phone didn’t make me a
            better person. I didn’t suddenly get six hours back in my day. (You
            don’t want to know my screen time. Or rather I don’t want you to know
            it, because I want to hang on to the barest shred of respect you may
            have for me.) It was fun to hang up calls by flipping the phone shut. I
            do use the internet less now than I did at the start of the month, but
            that’s not really attributable to the flip phone, but rather because I
            locked my iPhone down so hard that it basically is a feature phone now.
            (No socials, no browsers, just texting and the Merlin bird
            identification app.)</p>
        <p>(The bird of the day is the swamp sparrow.)</p>
        <p>To be clear, the flip phone did its job capably. It made calls; it
            received calls. It sent text messages; it received text messages. One
            time I forgot to register my parking pass before I drove to work and I
            used the flip phone’s web browser to access the parking portal. It took
            ten minutes but hey it’s better than a university parking ticket. It
            took orders of magnitude longer to type out text messages but that’s not
            necessarily a bad thing. I got to learn T9 and it’s always fun to learn
            new skills. I would have called people more but who really wants to get
            interrupted in the middle of their day. That’s not really the world we
            live in anymore.</p>
        <p>And that’s the rub, isn’t it. The flip phone isn’t just a phone, it’s
            a concrescence of social tendencies and structures that reflect the
            world of its time c. 2004. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing — although
            having lived through 2004 once I am wary of romanticizing it — but it is
            more friction than I am necessarily capable of taking on at this
            particular juncture in my life. I do think that technological friction
            is a good thing; I think one of the major problems with Phone is that it
            lets you do things easily that should be in fact very, very hard.
            (Things like: taking photographs, or disseminating your thoughts to a
            few million people at once.) But there’s a limit to which I have the
            capacity for extra friction around, say, calling my wife to ask if we
            have enough salad dressing for dinner and the call silently never
            getting delivered because she was in a dead spot for 4G service in our
            house. (To be fair this one is Verizon’s fault. But to have a flip phone
            is to constantly ask yourself if you’re willing to work even further
            around a superstructure that is absolutely never going to budget an inch
            for you.)</p>
        <p>In the end, I eschewed the flip phone for one very simple reason: I
            still had to end up carrying my smartphone around much of the time. I
            need to use an app to get into my building at work. My car doesn’t have
            built-in GPS anymore, and occasionally I do like to know where I’m
            driving. And despite my best efforts, ain’t nobody was going to call me
            on the flip phone besides my wife who loves me very much and knows after
            fifteen years how to put up with my cockamamie technological
            schemes.</p>
        <p>I am still keeping my Phone locked down as much as I can. At least
            now I have one fewer thing to carry around. Maybe one day they will make
            a Phone that is less of a Phone and more of a phone, and we can find
            some middle ground in this muddled mess we’re in. Until then, at least
            I’ll still get the bird of the day.</p>
        <p>So that I don’t leave you hanging:</p>
