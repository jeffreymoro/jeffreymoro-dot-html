        <h2 id="f-major">24. F major</h2>
        <p>Fuck ass key. Like running across flat ground and then tripping on a
            little rock. Very clearly for brass instruments. Unsubtle and
            boorish.</p>
        <h2 id="g-major">23. G major</h2>
        <p>ooooh look at me I’m G majorrrrrr I’m just as boring as C major but I
            try to stand out with my extra little sharp aren’t I <em>dainty</em>
            aren’t I <em>demure</em> fuck OFF</p>
        <h2 id="c-minor">22. C♯ minor</h2>
        <p>Here’s the thing about C♯ minor. When I was younger it was my
            favorite key mostly because of Chopin leaning heavy on it to express
            Yearning but also Tempestuousness (two things a closeted
            thirteen-year-old knows plenty about) but after I have gotten older I
            have come to see it as a bit trite and also it lays annoyingly in the
            hand. When we grow up we must put aside childish things and etc.</p>
        <h2 id="c-major">21. C major</h2>
        <p>Normal-type key. I mean it’s fine. But it doesn’t really
            <em>stand</em> for anything, you know? Identity crisis of a key.
        </p>
        <h2 id="a-major">20. A major</h2>
        <p>Boring idk not much more to say here.</p>
        <h2 id="d-minor">19. D minor</h2>
        <p>D minor gets a bit of a bad rap because of the whole “saddest of the
            keys” line from <em>Spinal Tap</em> but here’s the thing. It <em>is</em>
            a sad key (although not the saddest) and it <em>does</em> have the
            virtue of having had the greatest single piece of Western music (the
            Chaconne from Bach’s Violin Partita) written in it; HOWEVER that does
            not overcome the fact that it has ONE FLAT like its enharmonic BITCH F
            major and that flat is anNOYing.</p>
        <h2 id="g-minor">18. G minor</h2>
        <p>This key is made for run-down haunted houses in Pittsburgh staffed by
            burn-out teenagers who are just a little tooooo in to the fact that
            they’re allowed to get as close to the patrons as possible without
            actually touching them.</p>
        <h2 id="b-major">17. B♭ major</h2>
        <p>Getting into keys that I start to actually like. The second flat
            helps it out a lot here, and the fact that playing in it often calls for
            better keys (esp. E♭) means that you don’t have to spend too much time
            in Annoying territory. When I was in my twenties my highest singing note
            was comfortably the F above middle C so playing in B♭ meant that I could
            use a comfortably full tessitura, but as I have grown agèd and infirm my
            range has dropped. So points off there.</p>
        <h2 id="a-minor">16. A minor</h2>
        <p>The theme to <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> is written in A minor. So it’s
            fine in my book for that alone.</p>
        <h2 id="c-minor-1">15. C minor</h2>
        <p>Baby’s first sad key but you know what it has a certain je ne sais to
            it that cannot be denied. Odd shapes in the hand though.</p>
        <h2 id="f-minor">14. F♯ minor</h2>
        <p>Now we’re getting into some interesting stuff. Love the tonal color
            that F♯ minor brings to the table but it has one fatal flaw: I have to
            squeeze a finger on a white key in between two black keys, and my adult
            hands are simply having none of that.</p>
        <h2 id="a-minor-g-minor">13. A♭ minor / G♯ minor</h2>
        <p>All the mystery and intrigue of F♯ minor but with the decency to give
            that middle finger some breathing room. Plus you get to modulate into B
            (more on this later).</p>
        <h2 id="b-minor">12. B minor</h2>
        <p>Now we’re starting to get into some actually sad keys. The
            two-sharped keys are much more civilized to play than their two-flat
            brethren. Still a bit of a squeeze there on the middle finger, but we
            take what we can get. I would say they need to invent a piano with
            slightly wider keys but then I guess that would fuck up octave runs. Oh
            well you can’t have em all.</p>
        <h2 id="d-major">11. D major</h2>
        <p>The Pastoral sonata is one of my favorites to play so that’s mostly
            why this gets the ranking it does. Pretty reasonable key to sing in too
            provided that no one gets itchy and calls for that high A.</p>
        <h2 id="e-major">10. E major</h2>
        <p>You are going to now see pronounced black key favoritism for the rest
            of this list. What can I say, I am a pianist with fairly large hands and
            any time I can languorously reach up to keys rather than squeeze
            downward I am going to be a happier camper.</p>
        <h2 id="a-major-1">9. A♭ major</h2>
        <p>This one is tricky because en face I don’t actually like playing in
            A♭ as such. But it permits modulation to some of my favorite keys, so if
            I start in A♭ I figure I won’t have to stay there very long.</p>
        <h2 id="e-minor">8. E minor</h2>
        <p>The actual saddest of keys btw.</p>
        <h2 id="e-major-1">7. E♭ major</h2>
        <p>Easiest key to sing in, hits all the right notes, lies right in the
            middle of my range. Now I know what you’re thinking. “But Jeffrey the G
            in the middle of the chord is crammed between two black keys, you
            downranked so many other keys for precisely the same formal feature.” To
            which I say this is MY website and MY list and I am allowed to be as
            INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT as I wish.</p>
        <h2 id="e-minor-1">6. E♭ minor</h2>
        <p>Now we’re getting to the good shit. Love black keys. Love floating on
            top of the keyboard. E♭ minor has a little of an identity crisis though.
            Maybe it’s just because it’s rarely composed in but I know really know
            what it stands for. It absorbs some of the melancholia from its adjacent
            E minor, but not enough to really distinguish it. An odd duck of a
            key.</p>
        <h2 id="f-minor-1">5. F minor</h2>
        <p>Eats C minor UP. Appassionata best minor-key Beethoven sonata by far
            accept no substitutions. A great balance between black and white
            keys.</p>
        <h2 id="b-minor-1">4. B♭ minor</h2>
        <p>Stentorian key. Feels Russian. Great modulation potential.</p>
        <h2 id="c-major-d-major">3. C♯ major / D♭ major</h2>
        <p>If something is in C I’m gonna transpose it up to D♭. If something is
            in D I’m gonna transpose it down to D♭. D♭ is a workhorse key. As Dylan
            sang in “Make You Feel My Love” (in D♭), it “won’t ever do you
            wrong.”</p>
        <h2 id="f-major-g-major">2. F♯ major / G♭ major</h2>
        <p>I love this annoying ass key. À Therese is my favorite sonata. Even
            if I can never really keep track of whether it’s the E or the B that’s
            sharped (it’s the E), I still think it has tremendous coloring.</p>
        <h2 id="b-major-1">1. B major</h2>
        <p>Chopin taught his pupils the B major scale first because he felt it
            was the key that laid best in the hands and he was absolutely correct. A
            beautiful key. It can be aching, it can be funny, it can be wise, truly
            does it all.</p>
