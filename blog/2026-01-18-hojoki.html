        <p>The late twelfth century was hard on Kyoto. On the twenty-eighth day
            of the Fourth Month, in the year Angen 3, a fire broke out in a
            ramshackle brothel in the southeast of the city, at the intersection of
            Higuchi Street and Tominokōji Street. Wind whipped the fire into a
            blaze, cutting a clear line of smoke and ash to the Suzaku Gate in the
            northeast. One third of Kyoto burned: the fire took down the Hall of
            State, the university, and the Popular Affairs Ministry, alongside
            countless homes and businesses. Three years later, so the stories say, a
            whirlwind rose up at the corner of Nakanomikado and Kyōgoku: it
            flattened four blocks. Gates and doors and possessions crashed against
            each other, and dust blotted out the sky. Two months later, perhaps
            heeding those soothsayers who saw in the fire and the wind ill portents,
            the emperor decreed that the capital should move. Naturally, many
            protested. Others, those who put their faith in the emperor, or who at
            least depended on their masters’ favor for their daily rice,
            disassembled their houses and floated them in pieces down the Yodo
            River. Later that winter, the emperor changed his mind and returned to
            Kyoto. But the houses were never rebuilt.</p>
        <p>A few years passed. Famine struck. Drought in the spring; typhoon in
            the fall. Rich men turned to begging door-to-door, but there was no one
            left from whom to beg. Bodies piled in the streets so high that horses
            and carriages couldn’t pass. Then, an earthquake. The land was torn open
            and was flooded with the sea. All was rubble. The aftershocks went on
            for three months, at first twenty or thirty quakes a day, then four or
            five, then one or two, gradually less and less, until finally the earth
            lay still. But what was above it could never again be how it was.</p>
        <p>“The current of the flowing river does not cease,” wrote the monk
            Kamo no Chōmei, “and yet the water is not the same water as before.”
            Chōmei was the son of a Shinto priest. He was lucky that his father’s
            position kept him north of the capital in relative comfort, but he was
            still close enough to Kyoto to record the various disasters that befell
            it. By the turn of the century, he had taken up a position in the
            Imperial Poetry Office. Poetry was serious business in Kamakura-era
            Japan. Chōmei spent the better part of three years editing and compiling
            official collections of <i>waka</i>, five-line verse, a predecessor of
            the <i>haiku</i> more familiar to Western audiences. The <i>waka</i>
            form was fixed: so fixed, in fact, that deviating from it practically
            disqualified one’s utterances as poetry at all. In the
            <i>Shinkokinshū</i>, published in Genkyū 2, Fujiwara no Teika
            wrote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A spring night’s <br/>floating bridge of dreams <br/>breaks: <br/>sky of cloud drift <br/>
                parting from a mountain peak.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The same year, Chōmei shocked his friends and relations by taking
            holy vows as a Buddhist monk and retreating into seclusion on the slopes
            of Mount Hino. He built for himself a ten-square-foot hut, which he
            described in his essay <i>An Account of a Ten-Square-Foot Hut</i>. The
            hut nothing more than a floor, posts, and a makeshift roof. It was
            easily disassembled and moved; Chōmei never bought land for it. But it
            afforded him still a few aesthetic pleasures. He extended the east eaves
            three feet to provide cover for burning brush. On the south, he built a
            bamboo verandah. Inside, he kept a painting of Amida Buddha, another of
            the Fugen bodhisattva, a copy of the Lotus Sutra, a koto, and a biwa.
            Vines overgrew much of the forest, but his view was open to the west. He
            wrote:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>In spring I see waves of wisteria. They glow in the west like
                lavender clouds. In summer I hear the cuckoo. Whenever I converse with
                him, he promises to guide me across the mountain path of death. In
                autumn the voices of twilight cicadas fill my ears. They sound as though
                they are mourning this ephemeral, locust-shell world. In winter I look
                with deep emotion upon the snow. Accumulating and melting, it can be
                compared to the effects of bad karma. When I tire of reciting the
                Buddha’s name or lose interest in reading the sutras aloud, I rest as I
                please, I dawdle as I like. There is no one to stop me, no one before
                whom to feel ashamed.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Outside my window here in Baltimore, snow is falling. I have a pot of
            red sauce simmering in my oven. The essence of Italian food, whether in
            its continental or immigrant form, is simplicity. Here is how I make my
            sauce:</p>
        <p>Begin with a couple glugs of olive oil and a knob of butter. Melt
            them together on medium heat in a heavy oven-safe pot. Preheat your oven
            to 325 F while you’re at it. I like to grate a few cloves of garlic and
            fry them briefly with a generous pinch of red pepper flakes. Then, add
            in two big cans of crushed tomatoes. You can buy the tomatoes whole and
            crush them yourself if, like me, you prefer to do things the difficult
            way. Stir it all together. Halve an onion, and a couple of carrots. Put
            them in the sauce. Bring it up to a boil. Add some salt, but not too
            much. You can always add more later. Then, turn the heat off, and move
            the pot into the oven. Let it simmer in the oven for as long as you can
            manage. Two hours is minimum; three is better; four, in my experience,
            is diminishing returns. Stir it every half hour or so.</p>
        <p>In a moment I will bundle myself up and trudge out in the snow to the
            corner store because I realized I forgot to buy more parmesan cheese
            when I was out earlier today. You can’t serve sauce without parmesan
            cheese. One more poem by Teika:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>No shelter to rest my horse <br/>or brush my sleeves, <br/>not a shadow <br/>at Sano
                Crossing <br/>in falling dusk.</p>
