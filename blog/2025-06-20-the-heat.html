      <p>“The temperature’s rising,” Brian Eno sang. Out of the ten tracks on
         Eno’s debut solo record <i>Here Come the Warm Jets</i>, released in
         1974, the third track, “Baby’s on Fire,” has always held me hypnotized.
         The song’s “plot,” such as it is: an unnamed woman on fire, papped by
         giggling onlookers, Eno crooning out her plight with a barely contained
         sneer — and then that guitar solo, three-and-a-half minutes of Robert
         Fripp freaking the fuck out over the steady cacophony of the song’s two
         (count ’em, two) chords. Fripp was no stranger to violent and surreal
         art rock: the opening track of his band King Crimson’s debut, <i>In the
            Court of the Crimson King</i>, released five years earlier, declaims
         “innocents raped with / napalm fire” over a set of accelerating free
         jazz riffs. The temperature in the 1960s and 1970s was no doubt rising,
         if metaphorically — meteorological data suggests that summers in the
         United States and Europe were if anything a bit cooler during those
         years compared to pre-industrial averages — but politically and
         socially, the heat was on.</p>
      <p>“Baby’s on Fire” opens with a pounding, slightly wobbly bass line
         from John Wetton, another King Crimson alumnus, who was also a member of
         Roxy Music with Eno. The strength of Wetton’s attack on the string
         threatens to take the A flat down a semitone, while around it skittering
         hi hats barely keep the time. From its opening seconds, the song’s
         coming apart at the seams. Eno’s vocals enter along with the synths, but
         neither offer any further relief — staccato pulsing drives the pace
         inexorably forward, the song never quite accelerating but always
         threatening to. The lyrics are mean. It’s not a particularly erudite
         characterization but I can’t think of a better word for it. Baby is
         burning, although she doesn’t seem to mind, as we all “look at her
         laughing / like a heifer to the slaughter.” The wind picks up, not to
         snuff the flames but to stoke them. “Lend some assistance / to the
         object”: what is that assistance? Not relief, but intensity — brighter
         flames for a better picture.</p>
      <p>And the guitar solo. It’s the song’s centerpiece by far, so much so
         that it threatens (perhaps succeeds) at stealing focus from our burning
         Baby — or perhaps rather the solo is her, the flames, the photos, the
         whole mise-en-scene. Fripp claims he had the flu while he recorded it,
         and it’s true, there’s something sick about it. It rises and falls like
         a fever. It’s unsettled, unsettling — and Eno’s “guitar treatments” (as
         the liner notes credit him) only destabilize the matter further. After a
         minute or so of winding lines, Fripp hunkers down into coiled trills,
         which Eno echoes off themselves. You can hear a foreshadowing of the
         <i>musique concrète</i> that would characterize Eno’s next few albums
         — <i>Discreet Music</i>, <i>Ambient 1</i>, <i>Music for Films</i>
         — albeit with a violence few tracks on those albums dare to
         approach.
      </p>
      <p>For a song so thoroughly about image, I’m struck by how much runtime
         Eno cedes to sonic abstraction. But what is there to be said, in the
         end, about a person on fire? Eleven years before “Baby’s on Fire,”
         Vietnamese monk Thích Quang Đúc self-immolated on a street in Saigon in
         protest of the Catholic South Vietnamese government. American journalist
         Malcolm Browne’s photograph of Đức’s act won several awards; the Vietnam
         War would continue for another twelve years. In an interview with the
         BBC in the mid-1990s, Browne said, “he had a packet of matches in his
         lap. He struck one of them and instantly he was enveloped in flame. I
         just kept shooting and shooting and shooting. And that protected me from
         the horror of the thing.” Eno’s delivery shares, if not Browne’s horror,
         then at least the desire for some kind of distance from the act. A thick
         syrup of snotty irony, layers of electronic manipulation — one way or
         another, we’re held at arm’s length from Baby, watching her burn.</p>
      <p>I’ve spent the week in Washington, DC, where I still live for a bit
         longer while we complete some renovations on our house in Baltimore.
         Here, as in much of the country east of the Rockies, the temperature is
         rising. A heat and humidity wave, caused by a dome of high atmospheric
         pressure over the Midwest drifting eastward, is going to drive
         temperatures to dangerous heights this weekend. And the energy in the
         city matches. Things are burning and it feels like all we can do is
         watch.</p>
      <p>I hope wherever this letter finds you you’re staying cool and safe.
         No bird report this week; I’ve spent much of it inside on a series of
         sprints at my workplace. I’ll let Eno play us off:</p>
