        <p>The low sweep of the Georgia coast looks at first as though a long
            war between land and sea has come to an uneasy truce. Each front has
            gained on the other until distinctions no longer hold, leaving exclaves
            and enclaves like a Balkan border: brackish pools and miniature lakes
            shape the negative space of a latticework of grass; above, crows and
            herons and turkey vultures prowl for their catch of the day. Roads risk
            the coast and bridges hold where they can. The sea, underneath all,
            secrets itself behind mangrove and palm, but you can still smell it. The
            salt-rot is in the dirt.</p>
        <p>The intracoastal waterway runs along the east coast of the United
            States from Massachusetts to Miami, an aqueous Appalachia. An
            understated collaboration between nature and government, the
            intracoastal comprises a patchwork of rivers, sounds, creeks (rhymes
            with “tricks”), and strategically dredged canals maintained by the Army
            Corps of Engineers, all together offering ships safe passage up and down
            the coast, a protected bike lane against the traffic of the Atlantic.
            The intracoastal is as old as its country, at least in idea: in the
            first days of the nascent nation, so fragile in its independence and
            eager to prove its worth to the world, Congress sought both to establish
            control over its unruly territory and to encourage the literal flow of
            commerce. The Sea Islands that embroider the Carolina and Georgia coasts
            were home to a thriving, violent plantation economy: rice and indigo
            flourished, tended by slaves whose descendants, the Gullah and the
            Geechee, weave the coast today. Crops traveled from the islands to
            Savannah and Charleston for sale; the cash traveled back down into the
            pockets of rich whites. As flows the Moon River, so flows capital.</p>
        <p>There is fragile beauty, still, in the marshes. Estuarine
            grasses—<i>sporobolus alterniflorus</i>, seed-thrower
            other-flower—dominate the waterways, pale woody stalks rising from the
            rivers to mop-top profusions of green. The grass builds the marsh:
            sediment collects at its roots, out of which grows more grass, a refuge
            too for the mussels and the trout and the sea bass and the snails that
            make their homes here. The latter work up and down the grass, eating the
            fungi and the insects and the rot feeding on it, keeping the grass neat
            and clean. The grass loves salt and the intracoastal is more than happy
            to provide. In turn, the grass feeds the water: when dying, dead,
            decaying, the grass melts into nutrients for other plants and animals
            alike where the soil, otherwise starved of oxygen by the salt, cannot.
            Clouds hang heavy in this part of the world.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on the streets of Savannah, spanish moss drapes grey-gold
            on the oak and the elm. The moss takes nothing from the trees but a
            place to rest. Science calls this relationship epiphytic,
            “upon-the-plant”: the moss does not interfere with the trees but simply
            uses them as scaffolds, hanging high above the ground, safe from any
            creature that might feast upon it. It shares this propensity with fellow
            members of the genus <i>Tillandsia</i>, air plants, which feed from
            the sky and not the soil. Most are epiphytic, like the moss; they are
            also therefore natural sensors of air pollution. You will not be shocked
            to learn that the moss has been retreating in recent years.</p>
        <p>The story of a place is a story of what built it. On whose backs a
            world is made. At the edge of things, one is especially sensitive to
            change. It hits borderlands first. But then again, we are all on borders
            between somewheres.</p>

        <p>My biweekly newsletter seems to have turned bimonthly. No surprise
            there: the beginning of the semester makes time hard to come by and what
            words we can find are precious and routed to other projects first. Some
            of those other projects are soon to bear fruit: with my colleagues and
            friends Tamara Kneese and Briana Vecchione, I have an edited cluster on
            algorithms and the occult with the journal <i>ASAP/J</i> forthcoming
            in a week or two; along similar lines, I was invited to the new podcast
            <i>Love + Machines</i>, hosted by Julia Park of the University of
            Toronto, to discuss my work on astrology and computation, which drops
            soon as well. Links forthcoming!
