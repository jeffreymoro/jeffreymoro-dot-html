        <p>Good afternoon Moronators. Class is not in session (UMD is blessedly
            still off for a few weeks yet). We are seven days into the new year and
            so much has already happened. We are at war(?) with Venezuela(??) or
            Greenland(???). My best friends had a baby (her name is Dorothy) (the
            baby, not my best friends) (although soon the baby will be my best
            friend too). My cat has learned how to jump onto the kitchen counter.
            It’s shaping up to be one hell of a year.</p>
        <p>But we’re going to ignore all of that for now, because this is a
            roundup post for 2025, a tire fire of a year during which nevertheless I
            experienced great personal growth and wrote a few things that I’m pretty
            proud of that I am going to shove into your inbox here on a Wednesday in
            January, because if there’s one thing I never learned how to do it’s
            execute a proper newsletter posting strategy. But to tell the truth, if
            I might expound for a moment (and what else is blogging for after all):
            it’s not like anyone else has any other strategy for how to write and
            share work on the internet or anywhere else anymore. I am not going to
            get all meta here (recall: this is a central promise of this blog)
            because I don’t need to tell <em>you</em> about our utterly degraded
            information environment in the year of our lord twenty twenty-six.
            You’re <em>reading</em> for Christ’s sake! You already know how bleak
            shit is out there. That being said I did receive the other day a very
            nice email from a stranger who had found my posts on a website called <a href="https://minifeed.net">minifeed.net</a>, which collects olde timey
            blogs just like this one, so perhaps there is hope for the written word
            on the internet after all.</p>
        <p>Anyway enough of all that. Let’s get down to brass tacks. Here are
            some things I wrote last year:</p>
        <h2 id="simulation-games-in-the-stratosphere">simulation games in the
            stratosphere</h2>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/simearth.jpg"></p>
        <p>Already I am cheating because this was a conference talk, not
            something published. But! I had a grand time at the Society for Cinema
            and Media Studies (SCMS) conference in Chicago in March, where I gave a
            talk titled “Simulation Games in the Stratosphere,” all about the 1990
            video game <em>SimEarth: The Living Planet</em>. In the olden days (grad
            school) I made a point of posting the text of my conference talks on my
            website. I don’t do this anymore for reasons of fashion and mystery, but
            I wanted to share a lil taste here:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>In 1990, the video game production studio Maxis released its first
                follow-up to its 1989 smash hit <em>SimCity</em>, a game titled
                <em>SimEarth: The Living Planet.</em> Whereas <em>SimCity</em> offered
                players the opportunity to model the comings and goings of an urban
                landscape, <em>SimEarth</em> expanded on its predecessor’s scope
                dramatically, simulating the geological and climatological development
                of a planet over billions of years, with striking mathematical
                complexity and granularity. Players develop planets through a range of
                scenarios, from the primordial magma of Earth’s earliest days, to the
                emergence of intelligent life, to expeditions to terraform planets
                modeled after Venus and Mars. Maxis’s chief developer Will Wright
                collaborated on the game with James Lovelock, an English scientist best
                remembered for his controversial “Gaia theory,” which contends that a
                planet’s biosphere functions as an “active adapter control system able
                to maintain [said planet] in homeostasis” (Lovelock and Margulis 3). In
                other words, feedback from a planet’s living organisms might
                substantially influence and maintain favorable climatological
                conditions. <em>SimEarth</em> takes an explicitly pedagogical view of
                its simulations: “it is a game, an educational toy, and an enjoyable
                tool,” writes technical writer Michael Bremer in the game’s substantial
                DOS user manual, wherein “life, climate, the atmosphere, and the planet
                itself . . . all affect each other” (2).
            </p>
            <p>In this talk, through a case study of <em>SimEarth</em>, I want to
                explore some formal relationships between climate modeling and gaming,
                both at the level of software implementation as well as aesthetic
                experience. I am chiefly interested in <em>SimEarth</em> as a game that
                one <em>plays</em> — or, as we shall see, that plays <em>itself</em> —
                and subsequently what <em>SimEarth</em> has to teach us about the notion
                of playing with climate, what such play entails and what its object
                might be. I define a genre of “climate simulation games,” which
                encompass scientific tools, video games, tabletop games, and other media
                objects, all which participate in a broader media-scientific history of
                atmospheric simulation. Through <em>SimEarth</em>, I’ll articulate a
                strategy of “climatological play” that undergirds this genre, a type of
                play that hinges on the manipulation of climatic variables towards a
                desired outcome, whether eco-utopian flourishing or total collapse. It’s
                in the balance between these two outcomes — flourishing and collapse —
                that I locate my argument today. For, following Jean-Thomas Tremblay’s
                and Stephen Swarbrick’s recent call in their book <em>Negative Life</em>
                to think <em>against</em> the environmental humanities’ habitual
                valorization of interdependence, generativity, and nature as what they
                call a “benevolent pedagogue,” I am most interested in how playing
                <em>SimEarth</em> overwhelmingly models ways for planets to <em>die</em>
                rather than to live. Failure, I’ll contend, over and against the
                pedagogical project of its creators, is <em>SimEarth</em>’s default
                end-state. I’ll track this notion of <em>SimEarth</em>’s failure — as a
                game, as a simulation — across its programming and gameplay experience,
                suggesting ultimately that the project of its climatological play is
                less to teach we humans how to care for the planet, and more to
                articulate how planets are themselves monstrous, non-human intelligences
                — intelligences that, even in simulation, evade human attempts at
                command or control.

        <p><img src="/assets/img/costar.jpg"></p>
        <p>Ok back to the actually published stuff. My biggest project this year
            was co-editing a research cluster for <em>ASAP/J</em>, the journal of
            the Association for the Study of the Arts of the Present, with my
            colleages <a href="https://www.tamarakneese.com/">Tamara Kneese</a> and
            <a href="https://brianavecchione.org/">Briana Vecchione</a>, titled <a href="https://asapjournal.com/cluster/algorithms-and-the-occult/">Algorithms
                and the Occult</a>. Tamara and I had been daring each other for
            <em>years</em> to do something on this theme, so it’s especially fun to
            see it out in the world. All the essays are worth your time; mine is
            titled <a href="https://asapjournal.com/node/as-above-so-below-astrological-data-in-the-age-of-co-star/">“As
                Above, So Below: Astrological Data in the Age of Co—Star.”</a> Here’s a
            taste:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I am a Cancer sun, Sagittarius moon, and Capricorn rising. My Mercury
                is in Cancer, which means my intellect is emotional and empathetic. I
                have Leo placements in Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, which indicates an
                extroverted nature. My Saturn is in Aquarius, which means that I am
                implacably stubborn; that Saturn is in my first house also means that I
                have trouble with my self-image. My Uranus and Neptune are in Capricorn
                and my Pluto is in Scorpio, traits that I share with those born in the
                first years of the 1990s. Collectively, we are responsible, serious, and
                hungry for power.</p>
            <p>Whether any of this rings true I will leave to my friends and family
                to decide. I learned these placements and their interpretations through
                Co–Star, darling astrology app of the terminally online. Billing itself
                as “the astrology app that deciphers the mystery of human relations
                through NASA data and biting truth,” Co–Star achieved widespread
                popularity during the Covid-19 lockdowns, claiming by the summer of 2023
                over 30 million registered users. The app’s pleasures are not hard to
                grasp. Its chic, monochromatic design breaks from astrology’s historic
                shawl-clad mysticism. Its snarky push notifications ignite a millennial
                limbic system trained on shitposts. And crucially for this essay, the
                app surfaces a wide array of astrological data, offering a panoply of
                potential interpretations of, influences on, and explanations for the
                daily torment of modern living. These data, Co–Star takes pains to
                trumpet in its marketing, draw from information collected by NASA’s Jet
                Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, alongside the work of human
                astrologers and poets. All these numerical and textual data enter the
                black box of artificial intelligence and emerge as horoscopes.</p>

        <p>Finally, I contributed a chapter to a new edited collection on
            landscape architecture and environmental media, edited by Karen
            M’Closkey and Keith VanDerSys of <a href="https://peg-ola.com/">PEG
                Office of Landscape + Architecture</a>. The volume is titled <a href="https://appliedresearchanddesign.com/product/media-matters-in-landscape-architecture"><em>Media
                    Matters in Landscape Architecture</em></a> and my chapter is titled
            “Measuring the Sky from the Curve of the Earth.” Karen and Keith put
            together a lovely collection of both media theorists (me!) and
            practicing landscape architects (not me!) to think together about how
            media constitute natural and built environments alike. My chapter is
            about weather stations:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>While individuals have maintained weather records throughout written
                civilization, weather stations emerge in a recognizably contemporary
                form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. They arose in part due
                to two historical and scientific tendencies: first, the invention of
                scientific instruments capable of measuring such qualities as
                temperature (the thermometer), humidity (the hygrometer), and wind speed
                (the anemometer); and second, a political drive to establish territorial
                control over newly expanding empires. In the United States, for
                instance, the first weather station networks were volunteer
                organizations that submitted observations in a tabular format to a
                central office run by the Smithsonian. In 1870, President Ulysses S.
                Grant signed a joint congressional resolution creating the Weather
                Bureau, the ancestor of today’s National Weather Service. Under the
                auspices of the Secretary of War, a testament to how weather data were
                considered complex and vital enough only to be entrusted to the armed
                forces, the Weather Bureau was tasked with “[taking] meteorological
                observations at the military stations in the interior of the continent.”
                Nevertheless, as historian of science Philipp Lehmann notes, the early
                stages of meteorological development were marked by a disjuncture
                between “the global vision” of data standardization and the messy
                physical realities of meteorology in practice: broken instruments and
                untrained observers alike stymied attempts to collect useful and
                consistent data. With the development of computational weather
                prediction in the 20th century, weather stations became increasingly
                sophisticated nodes in a digital network. New kinds of sensing
                technologies alongside their concomitant miniaturization further
                multiplied weather stations and made their operations possible in more
                challenging environments, from far-flung islands to inner cities.
                However, the distribution of weather stations is still imperfect,
                leading to elisions in the data they collect. Furthermore, their
                operation is contingent on proper geographic siting, to say nothing of
                mitigating signal interference from both human-made and natural causes.
                As media technologies, weather stations are thus in continuous
                conversation with the landscapes in which they operate, not simply as
                observers of conditions, but as active participants in the construction
                of meaningful weather data.</p>
            <p>This chapter explores the formal relationship between weather
                stations and the landscapes they mediate. In it, I argue that weather
                stations as media technologies themselves are key to a meteorological
                project of distinction – that is, distinguishing between those
                environmental phenomena that will produce meaningful data and those that
                are statistical noise or interference. Articulating these distinctions
                entails a range of media techniques for the calibration of landscapes,
                from site selection to ongoing landscape management, which in turn
                influence a station’s capacity to collect “good” data. Furthermore, just
                as technical instruments mediate landscapes, so too do landscapes leave
                their traces on instruments themselves, wearing them down over time and
                leaving friction and gaps in the meteorological record.</p>

        <p>It’s a false spring today in Baltimore, the kind of day that inspires
