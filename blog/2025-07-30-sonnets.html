      <p>I have been derelict in writing these past few weeks, to no small
         shame given that I got through two posts of this blog slash newsletter
         slash thing and immediately fell off the wagon. <i>Mea culpa.</i> My
         excuse: that I have been packing up my life in DC and moving it, after
         months of stops and starts, to Baltimore. We’re mostly unpacked. The cat
         is unfazed. I have spent more money than I thought even possible. It’s
         an adjustment, a good one, I think.</p>
      <p>I set a few private rules out for myself when I started writing this
         blog. One of them was: no writing about writing. Too often, in the
         absence of other topics of discourse, online writing becomes intolerably
         self-reflexive, turning ever inward on itself. Online eats the world
         like that. You’ll recognize this in any nascent social media platform:
         all the posts, at first, are about the platform, for lack of anything
         else better to say. I wanted this blog to be about things in the world.
         But I am going to bend this rule a bit now, if only because writing is
         also a thing in the world. <i>Mea maxima culpa.</i></p>
      <p>I have been trying to live without my phone more. I’m not very good
         at it. I cling to it, an accessory appendage. I delete apps, set up
         blockers, nothing really works. Like a smoker, I still need to find my
         gum: something to replace the compulsion. For a week or so, I tried
         writing sonnets.</p>
      <p>I am not a poet by trade. I have the good sense not to show any of
         them to you, so don’t worry, you’re off the hook. I started writing them
         because I didn’t feel like downloading Wordle and I wanted some kind of
         word puzzle to occupy my time. I gave myself another rule when writing
         them (can you tell I like rules), which was that I couldn’t use any kind
         of rhyming dictionary. The sonnets became trials in scansion, which I
         appreciated for, if nothing else, the chance to exercise some atrophied
         parts of my brain. Most of them ended up being in trochaic pentamenter,
         an uncommon meter. Most sonnets in English, thanks to Bill Shakespeare,
         are iambic. duh DUN duh DUN duh DUN and so forth. Trochees are the
         opposite. DUN duh DUN duh DUN duh. They’re less naturalistic, more
         martial. The lines end in unstressed syllables, what we call in the lit
         crit biz “feminine endings.” This made it a bit harder for me to come up
         with rhymes. Habit/rabbit; clover/plover; flowers/bowers; I gravitate to
         nature writing everywhere, it seems.</p>
      <p>The process, which I gave up after a week because packing just got
         too hectic and also the candy-colored dopamine drip of my phone was too
         alluring, got me thinking about how rare poetry is in my daily life. I
         read it on occasion, I can quote the requisite number of lines befitting
         my degrees, but I can’t say it’s a frequent presence. Writing it, even
         less so. This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot over the past
         few years: the nearly comprehensive shift in Western culture away from
         “art” as a practice that all humans engage in some capacity and towards
         “art” as a commodity, created by a rarified class, and bought and
         transacted by everyone else. I play piano. I’ve played it nearly every
         day for two and a half decades. Apart from when I was taking lessons as
         a child, I’ve never given a performance. It’s art I make privately for
         myself, which brings me great joy. Why not poetry too?</p>
      <p>When I was in udnergrad, I took a class on “traditional” Japanese
         literature, which for Japan scholars means from around 600 to 1600 CE.
         One thing that has stuck with me from that class over the years was
         learning how important poetry composition was to the social life of the
         royal Japanese court. The ability to fire off a quick <i>waka</i>
         (it’s like a <i>haiku</i> with a couple extra lines) could mean
         securing a promotion, the favor of the Emperor, or the attention of a
         courtesan. It’s absurd to imagine in 2025: trading poems as a way to
         secure one’s social status, to even participate in some kind of social
         life. Writing has become so diffuse, audiences so fickle (or absent):
         it’s something I’ve been struggling with these past few years, as so
         much has changed about ecosystem of letters, whether online or off-. How
         do you write when you don’t know if you have an audience, a community of
         readers, of fellow writers? Writing, I suppose, has to become a
         compulsion: something you do anyway, no matter who’s reading,
         commenting, criticizing. It’s a better compulsion than scrolling, at
         least.</p>
      <p>Today, it’s hot. Surface-of-the-sun hot. We’re wrapping up our
         second, maybe third heat wave of the summer. I hope it’s the last.
