        <p>You want your feet on the ground. I see too many people at my gym
            forget this part. They’ll have just their toes or the balls of their
            feet on the ground, but not the whole thing, not the heel. Full, flush
            contact, feet pulled back as far as they will go. There are some
            variations in which you might take them off the ground: I’ve seen folks
            brace them up on the bench itself, even. But for the most part, you want
            your feet on the ground.</p>
        <p>The next part is the shoulders. They’re a bit tricky: it took me a
            few years until I felt confident in them. You want to pull them
            together, like you’re holding a pencil between your shoulder blades.
            It’s easy then to have them hunched too far up into your neck. Our traps
            (those are the muscles in your upper back that probably hurt right now,
            go head, let them drop) are so tight from all the phones and screens and
            desks. After you pull your shoudlers together, you want to pull them
            <em>down</em>, as though you were tucking the blades into your back
            pockets. Keep them solid and secure.
        </p>
        <p>Then your back. Paradoxically you don’t want it flush against the
            bench. You want a little bit of an arch, just enough so that someone
            could slide their palm between your back and the bench. Not too much
            though: sometimes I’ll see these kids, they probably have been watching
            too many powerlifters on YouTube, and they’ll be arched up full like a
            cat on Halloween. Just a gentle bend, nothing more.</p>
        <p>And then you look up and there’s the bar. I’ve been working with
            barbells for about five years now. It’s longer than many but a pittance
            to some. I’m not a coach or anything but I am someone who tries to do
            things with intention. I don’t do anything by halves. If you know me,
            you know this about me: if I’m going to do something, I’m going to do
            all of it. And so when I look up at the bar, I take a moment to collect
            myself and think about what I’ve done and what I’m going to do, the
            weight that I’m going to move, and I try to give myself over entirely to
            it, to use all of myself to do it. There is a certain truth, I have
            found, to the presumption that meatheads don’t have a lot going on
            between their ears. Which is not to say that lifters are stupid, far
            from it. But rather than in the moment of moving the weight, you have to
            clear the bullshit out of your mind, because for the next ten seconds,
            you’re going to need all of yourself for what you’re about to do.</p>
        <p>Hands about shoulder width apart. Rotate your palms inward a bit:
            they call this “bulldog grip.” Keep the bar in the meat of your palm.
            Don’t let your wrists drop back, but also don’t keep them totally
            straight either. You want to stack the bar joint over joint, to
            stabilize it and protect yourself. And then you push the bar up.</p>
        <p>I don’t know if what I’m about to offer as a quote is a real quote. I
            did a little bit of searching but Google is pretty useless these days,
            and I just combinations of flattering AI slop and SEO-optimized garbage
            that was also AI slop. But I used to be a dancer. Not the kind you’re
            thinking, like I don’t know ballet or tap or anything that could get you
            a job on a chorus line. I was trained in “movement”: contact
            improvisation, performance art, things of that nature. But I remember
            hearing someone, maybe a teacher, say to me once that dance is a
            conversation is gravity. That’s the quote, that dance is a conversation
            with gravity. I think it’s true of lifting as well. I think it’s why ten
            years after I stopped dancing, I found that conversation again under the
            bar.</p>
        <p>Because when you lift a weight, however you’re lifting it, you need
            to think not only about whatever pushing or pulling you’re doing but
            also its opposite. You need to think about how gravity is acting on you
            and how you can counter it with the force of your will. That’s why it’s
            so important that you keep your feet on the ground. Because while you’re
            pushing the bar up with your arms, you also need to push down with your
            feet into the earth. “Leg drive,” they call it. One force (the bar
            upward) requires another, stabilizing force (feet downward). A muscle
            never moves a weight alone.</p>
        <p>It’s high summer here in Baltimore. The air has a sticky weight to
            it. I bike to and from the gym now, past old, massive houses. Things are
            quieter here than I am used to, but I take as an opportunity. For what,
            I’m not sure yet. I think I need the quiet to find out. I’ll let Harry
            Hosono have the last word:</p>
