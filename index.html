        <h3>→<span id="namespace"></span>Jeffrey Moro, PhD</h3>
        <p>I’m a writer, teacher, and tinkerer based in Baltimore, Maryland. Most of my work engages in some way with either computers or the environment—often both at once. I’m interested in how we use media technologies to understand and represent the natural world, and the cultural and material consequences of such technologies for our collective relationship with—and responsibility toward—the planet.</p> 
        <p>Right now, I’m working on a book titled <i>Cloud Studies: A Media
          Archaeology of the Atmosphere</i>, which explores the mediation of
        the atmosphere as data from Earth’s surface to outer space. Through
        readings on meteorological arts and technologies—from electronic weather
        diaries to climate simulation games, artificial meteors to experimental
        radio art—I show how media shape our cultural as much as scientific
        understanding of the atmosphere. In particular, I argue that with the
        rise of computational meteorology, we’ve come to imagine the atmosphere
        <i>as</i> a computer, one that we hope to program as a way out of
        climate change. I’ve published essays related to this project in the <i>Journal of Environmental Media</i>, <i>Media Fields</i>, and <i>Amodern</i>, <a href="/research">among others</a>.</p>
        <p>Other research interests of mine include media theory and history, electronic literature, vintage and obsolete computers, software (especially video game) preservation, textual history, media archaeology, technologies of the occult, procedural aesthetics, nature writing, the cultural history of the internet, and barbell weightlifting.</p>

        <h2>> ls -affiliations</h2>
        <p>I currently hold the position of Assistant Clinical Professor in Digital Humanities and Digital Studies at the <a href="https://mith.umd.edu/">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I’m also affiliated with <a href="https://aadhum.umd.edu/">African American Digital and Experimental Humanities</a> (AADHum) and the <a href="https://aim.umd.edu/">Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland</a> (AIM). Among my various research and teaching duties at MITH, I steward its retrocomputing collections, including the Bill Bly and Deena Larsen Collections of Electronic Literature, and run its undergraduate internship program in retrocomputing. I also teach occasionally for UMD’s Immersive Media Design program and its English department’s Digital Storytelling and Poetics minor.</p>

        <p>I received my PhD in English with a certificate in Digital Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park. I’m a co-founder of the <a href="https://irlhumanities.org/">Immersive Realities Labs for the Humanities</a> (irLh), a multidisciplinary research lab that integrates emerging digital technologies with humanistic critique. Past lives include work as a site manager for <i>Romantic Circles</i>, a born-digital journal of Romantic literary studies, and as a post-baccalaureate resident with Five College Digital Humanities.</p>
