        <h3>→<span id="namespace"></span>Jeffrey Moro, PhD</h3>
        <p>I’m a writer, teacher, and tinkerer based in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
        <p>My research focuses on computation and the environment, particularly how artists and scientists use digital media to understand, manipulate, and theorize the natural world as information. I’m currently writing a book titled <i>Cloud Studies: Atmospheric Data and Media Arts</i>, which explores the mediation of the atmosphere as data from Earth’s surface to outer space, through readings of artworks ranging from electronic weather diaries to climate simulation games. My essays have appeared in the <i>Journal of Environmental Media</i>, <i>Media Fields</i>, and <i>Amodern</i>, among others.</p>
        <p>Alongside environmental media, other research and teaching interests of mine include media theory and history, vintage and obsolete computers, software (especially video game) preservation, textual history, media archaeology and physical computing, technologies of the occult, procedural aesthetics (especially in experimental literature), nuclear cultures, nature writing, and barbell weight training.</p>

        <h2>> ls -affiliations</h2>
        <p>I hold the position of Assistant Clinical Professor in Digital Humanities and Digital Studies at the <a href="https://mith.umd.edu/">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I’m also affiliated with <a href="https://aadhum.umd.edu/">African American Digital and Experimental Humanities</a> (AADHum) and the <a href="https://aim.umd.edu/">Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland</a> (AIM).</p>

        <p>I received my PhD in English with a certificate in Digital Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park.
