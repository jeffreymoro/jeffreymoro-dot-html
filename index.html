        <h3>→<span id="namespace"></span>Jeffrey Moro, PhD</h3>
        <p>I’m a writer, teacher, and tinkerer based in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
        <p>My research focuses on how we use media technologies to represent the natural world as information, and the consequences of those representations for how we imagine humanity existing within, alongside, and over nature. I’m currently writing a book titled <i>Cloud Studies</i>, which explores the mediation of the atmosphere as data from Earth’s surface to outer space, through readings of artworks ranging from electronic weather diaries to climate simulation games, alongside scientific techniques from the history of meteorology and atmospheric science. My essays have appeared in <i>Journal of Environmental Media</i>, <i>Media Fields</i>, and <i>Amodern</i>, <a href="/research">among others</a>.</p>
        <p>Alongside environmental media, other research and teaching interests of mine include media theory and history, vintage and obsolete computers, software (especially video game) preservation, textual history, media archaeology, technologies of the occult, procedural aesthetics (especially in poetry), nuclear cultures, nature writing, the cultural history of the internet, and barbell weight training.</p>

        <h2>> ls -affiliations</h2>
        <p>I hold the position of Assistant Clinical Professor in Digital Humanities and Digital Studies at the <a href="https://mith.umd.edu/">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I’m also affiliated with <a href="https://aadhum.umd.edu/">African American Digital and Experimental Humanities</a> (AADHum) and the <a href="https://aim.umd.edu/">Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland</a> (AIM). Among my various duties at MITH, I steward its retrocomputing collections, including the Bill Bly and Deena Larsen Collections of Electronic Literature, and run its allied undergraduate internship program in retrocomputing. I also teach occasionally in UMD's Immersive Media Design program and the English department's Digital Storytelling and Poetics minor.</p>

        <p>I received my PhD in English with a certificate in Digital Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park. I’m also a co-founder of the <a href="https://irlhumanities.org/">Immersive Realities Labs for the Humanities</a> (irLh), a multidisciplinary research lab that integrates emerging digital technologies with humanistic critique. Past lives include work as a site manager for <i>Romantic Circles</i>, a born-digital journal of Romantic literary studies, and as a post-baccalaureate resident with Five College Digital Humanities.</p>
