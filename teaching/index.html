        <p>Alongside environmental media, my teaching focuses on media theory and history, vintage and obsolete computing, software (especially video game) preservation, and experimental modes of writing and storytelling. On the one hand, I consider myself a traditionalist: my classes tend to circle around the time-honored strategies of closely reading and debating (theoretical, creative, historical) texts. But on the other hand, all of my classes feature some aspect of hands-on critical and creative work, whether it’s learning how to take apart and repair Apple ][’s, experiment with cyanotype printing, or plain old-fashioned soldering.</p>
        <p>Recent classes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Archaeologies of Gaming and Electronic Literature, a retrocomputing internship program run through MITH.</li>
            <li>Advanced Media Theory, for UMD’s Immersive Media Design program, a joint degree program between the Department of Art and the School of Computer Science.</li>
            <li>Introduction to Digital Studies, designed as from the ground up for UMD’s English program.</li>
        </ul>
