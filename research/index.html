        <p>My current book project is titled <i>Cloud Studies: A Media Archaeology of the Atmosphere</i>. It explores the mediation of the atmosphere as data from Earth’s surface to outer space. Through readings on meteorological arts and technologies—from electronic weather diaries to climate simulation games, artificial meteors to experimental radio art—I show how media shape our cultural as much as scientific understanding of the atmosphere. The book is structured in five chapters, each corresponding to one of the layers of the atmosphere: the troposphere at the bottom near ground level, then above it the stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere/ionosphere, and finally the exosphere at the edge of space. Across these chapters, I argue that with the rise of computational meteorology, we’ve come to imagine the atmosphere <i>as</i> a computer, one that we hope to program as a way out of climate change.</p>
        <p>I’m also developing a second book project on the media history of the almanac: I’m interested in the almanac’s role in the long history of environmental data, as a technology of prediction, and how it helps us think about intersections between the occult and “legitimate” science.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Sensing Sferics</b>. Project director, 2023 – present. An environmental media lab about the scientific and artistic practice of listening to radio atmospheric signals (or “sferics”) released by phenomena such as lightning and aurora. Lab activities include taking recordings of sferics from sites across the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic and workshops on DIY radio and listening practices. <a href="https://sferics.jeffreymoro.com/">https://sferics.jeffreymoro.com/</a></li>
